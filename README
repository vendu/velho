Welcome to the Velho project.

I started Velho to grab together my earlier code, mostly the better parts mostly
from

	https://github.com/vendu/OS-Zero/

I'm planning to put the reinvention of UNIX/POSIX on the backburner in order to
work on something novel. I plan a new microprocessor - feel free to take a peek
on the instruction set draft at

	https://github.com/vendu/velho/blob/master/sys/v0/doc/INSTRUCTIONS.txt

or browse around in the Velho repository.

Other parts of Velho are some libraries, e.g. a new implementation of the C
standard library at

	https://github.com/vendu/velho/blob/master/usr/lib/c

The initial goals of the project are a new microprocessor called V0, the
development toolchain for it (assembler, C compiler, build tools, the works),
and a game console running on V0.

Chill out and have a good time!
