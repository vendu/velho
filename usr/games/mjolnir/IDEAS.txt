<ams> Classic cyberpunk characters were marginalized, alienated loners who lived
on the edge of society in generally dystopic futures where daily life was
impacted by rapid technological change, an ubiquitous datasphere of computerized
information, and invasive modification of the human body. -- lawrence person

Introduction
------------

Legend has it that many moons ago, Fenris, the eldest child of Loki and
Angrboda, broke free from his chain, Pleignir, and stole Mjolnir from Thor.
Fenris is believed to have hidden Mjolnir, Thor's hammer, into a dungeon.

It is said that Thor shall ascend the one to return Mjolnir to a deity for
saving the world from the forces of evil creating chaos with lightnings and
thunder. Clairvoyants say evil forces are already on the hunt for Mjolnir.

Armed with nothing more than a few food rations, your pet dog, a +1 blessed
armor, a +3 neutral sword, and a piece of Pleignir, you enter the Dungeon.

Good luck, adventurer, and beware of Fenris!
