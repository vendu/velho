V0 MACHINE ARCHITECTURE
-----------------------

INTRODUCTION
------------

V0 stems from more than 2 decades of hacking code on Unix-like systems such as
Linux and FreeBSD. At around 2004, I decided to do a new UNIX/POSIX-like
operating system. More than 100,000 lines of code into the project, I'm taking a
turn to give my shot at designing a new microprocessor, a toolchain of
[at least] an assembler and C compiler for it, and a new operating system kernel
as well as libraries for it. The plan would be to write a couple of books on the
project, too.

Whereas relatively simple, the V0 processor has features to facilitate virtual
memory, multithreading, multiprocessing, as well as other capabilities of
multitasking operating systems.
