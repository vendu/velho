Preface
-------

In Loving Memory of my late father Heikki Venäläinen, my mother Saima
Venäläinen, my family and friends who are numerous and know but especially miss
The One who got me back in spirit after an unlikely incident of a successful
heart surgery around the New Year of 2017/2018, as well as for her Spirit and
dedication of bringing me back to life (better than ever, I have to say).

Other people worth mentioning are Carsten "Rasterman" Haitzler for his ongoing
support and interest in my projects (although man you're too busy with your
work, we only have a few finishing touches left for world domination), Lauri
Kortevaara from childhood for his endless enthusiasm, Niko Mykkänen and his
family for their support, anyone and everyone who's helped me and stood my side
(there's _way_ too many) of you to mention but the next time we meet let's have
a mean party, OKAY?) :P

I hereby extend my respect, best wishes, and support for the lively hacker
community surrounding the free and open software movement. Richard M. Stallman,
William Jolitz, the lively BSD camp, Linus Torvalds and the rest for Linux,
Michael Abrash, Sir Donald Knuth, old school Unix hackers such as Hannu
Aronsson from Helsinki University of Technology, Jari Taskinen, Jyri Sarha,
Mika Pekonen, PhD Lasse Huovinen, PhD Tommi Junttila, people such as Petri
Halttunen, Matti Änkö, Tomi Engdahl, Timo Larmela, Juha Parviainen, the
Korvenkylä Bunch (remember the endless days of playing games on our C64? :)),
anyone and everyone from Juankoski, especially people such as Tero Kettunen,
Timo & Pentti Heikkinen, Janne Anttonen, Matti Vento, Jani Pirinen, Pasi
Savolainen, Tuomo Holopainen, Juho Tenhunen, Pekka Tuppurainen, Jani Remes, The
Pitkänen brothers Timo & Esa, and of course all of the lovely ladies behind us.

I want to thank Ismo Peltola, Lauri Loven, Antti Karanta, Jyrki Anttonen, Tero
Hurskainen, Markus Äijänen, Vesa Veijonen, Jukka Siltanen, Pekka Hartikainen,
Ismo FIXME, Nina Pöyhönen, Pasi Seppälä, and the rest of the Espoo and Helsinki
people whom I've had the pleasure of having good times during the "student" days
(yeah right, I'm not the one to sit at lectures, as you guys know I was always
way too busy with my own projects to pay much attention).

I deliberately chose to not charge for the book so I won't need to bother with
bureaucracy too much but will instead keep giving back to the community of all
of us doing our work for the Love for the Arts!

I hereby encourage our juniors and future generations to keep exploring,
breaking, fixing, and hacking (note that I did not say cracking) the Universe
and everything within and beyond.

Peace & Love Forever,

Tuomo Petteri Venäläinen /* vendu@oszero.org */

OUR PLANET'S IN DANGER,
MANKIND AT WAR.

and Especially to The One True Love of My Life ;)

Velho Microprocessor Introduction
---------------------------------

Velho Microprocessor #0, from now on V0 for short, is my humble attempt to
redesign a modern, RISC-style load-store architecture for multiprocessor and
multicore systems running heavily multithreaded/parallelized applications.

Another new thing I plan on bringing up is a new operating system kernel I
decided to n ame Zen. After 20+ years of mostly Unix-like operating systems and
trying to redesign them I thought I might as well go for something novel and
in order to advance the purposes of education, self-learning, and science;
first and foremost, computer engineering. :)

In addition to a typical instruction set suitable for compiling and running
highly efficient code written in languages such as C, I plan on including
certain features such as fused operations for typical scenarios of code
optimization. I plan on auto-coloring of cache slots for incoming data and
code to increase the distribution of read data more evenly between cache slots.
