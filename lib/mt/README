Zero Threads - libmt
--------------------

libmt is a relatively early code-base. Some basic synchronization primitives
have been tested quite extensively on IA-32, AMD-64, as well as some versions
of the ARM microprocessor family.

First off, I'm going to list some of the more interesting/mature code modules
in /usr/lib/mt. Here we go.

Module          Files                   Brief
------          -----                   -----
mtx             mtx.c, mtx.h            mutexes and "fast" (nonrecursive) ones
spin*           spin*.c, spin*.h        spinlocks
tktlk           tktlk.h                 ticket locks

Here are some items worth noting of their locklessinc.com origins. Revamps and
implementations of some algorithms in their articles section as well as the
comments.

Module          Files                   Brief

bar             bar.c, bar.h            thread barrier package
priolk          priolk.c, priolk.h      priority locks
