# Velho Project README File
  ---

Welcome to the Velho project.

I started Velho to grab together my earlier code, mostly the better parts mostly
from

[zero](https://github.com/vendu/OS-Zero/)

I'm planning to put the reinvention of UNIX/POSIX on the backburner in order to
work on something novel. I plan a new microprocessor - feel free to take a peek
on the instruction set draft at

[instruction set](https://github.com/vendu/velho/blob/master/sys/v0/doc/ins.txt)

or browse around in this Velho repository.

Other parts of Velho are some libraries, e.g. a new implementation of the C
standard library at

[c library](https://github.com/vendu/velho/blob/master/usr/lib/c)

as well as my older library of miscellaneous tools at

[zero library](https://github.com/vendu/velho/blob/masater/usr/lib/zero)

The initial goals of the project are a new microprocessor called V0, the
development toolchain for it (assembler, C compiler, build tools, the works),
and a game console running on V0.

Last but not least, the distribution already includes a playable version

[core war](https://github.com/vendu/velho/blob/master/usr/games/corewar)

of an old instruction set of Core War(s) described in

[red code](https://github.com/vendu/velho/blob/master/usr/games/corewar/doc/redcode-icws-88-2.pdf)

Chill out and have a good time!
