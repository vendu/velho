    Introduction

There are many reasons to omit integer division from the instruction set
of a computer. In the early days of computing, the cost of this hardware
was a dominant factor, and it still dominates in the world of
programmable microcontrollers such as the PIC family of chips made by
Microchip. Today, the difficulties cleanly integrating divide hardware
into pipelined systems has led to the omission of integer divide
hardware from a surprising number of high performance microprocessors
and DSP chips.

Such an omission can only be justified if division can be done
efficiently in software, and fortunately, this is the case! Most integer
division operations found in real programs involves division by a
constant, and it turns out that division by a constant can always be
replaced by multiplication by the reciprocal of that constant. Even when
divide hardware is available, it is quite common to find that divide
instructions take more than twice as long as multiply instructions, and
as a result, reciprocal multiplication is frequently the preferred way
to handle integer division!

Elimination of multiply instructions is itself desirable. For example,
according to the Pentium instruction timings available from Quantasm
Corporation <http://www.quantasm.com/opcode_i.html>, The base time for a
32-bit integer add or subtract on that machine (discounting operand
fetch and other overhead) is 1 clock cycle, and both can sometimes be
paired with other instructions for concurrent execution. In contrast, a
32-bit multiply takes 10 cycles and a divide takes 41 cycles, and
neither can be paired. Clearly, these instructions should be avoided
wherever possible.

The goal of the remainder of this presentation is to investigate how
division by constants, particularly by 10, can be efficiently coded for
unsigned integers on a machine without using multiply or divide
instructions; on the way, we will briefly visit efficient multiplication
by constants. Most of this presentation will use C syntax, avoiding the
details of actual machine instructions, and after each technique is
explored, it will be applied to other divisors.

Our emphasis is on methods that produce exact results for integer
division, but these methods are closely related and in many cases based
on methods that produce approximate results for division of fixed-point
fractions. These latter methods focus on minimizing the expected error,
while our focus is on methods that give a remainder that lies between
zero and one less than the divisor.

    Fixed Point Fractions


      Fixed Point Number Representations

To divide by 10, we will multiply by 1/10, but while this is easily
said, we need to talk about the representation of 1/10 on a computer
before we go into details. The fraction 1/10 can be represented as
0.1_10 ; on converting this to binary, we get 0.00011/0011/_2 , which is
an infinite repeating fraction, not unlike the situation with 1/3 in
decimal, which is 0.333/3/_10 ; the repeat string in such fractions is
traditionally marked by an overbar; here, this is rendered /like this/.
The following table shows the binary reciprocals of some common small
integers.

n 	1/n base 2
2 	.1
3 	.0101/01/
4 	.01
5 	.00110011/0011/
6 	.00101/01/
7 	.001001/001/
8 	.001
9 	.000111/000111/
10 	.000110011/0011/
11 	.00010111/0100010111/
12 	.000101/01/
13 	.0001001/110110001001/
14 	.0001001/001/
15 	.00010001/0001/

Many programmers assume, on seeing a fraction like 0.1_10 , that this
must be represented as a floating point number, but this is not so!
Fixed point representations, in which the point is implicitly placed
between any bits of the binary representation of a number, have been
used since the dawn of the computer age. When fixed-point numbers are
used, all arithmetic operations use integer arithmetic, and this leads
to a considerable performance advantage.

For our purpose, the fraction 0.000110011..._2 is represented as follows
on a 16 bit machine:

    .0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 
    |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
    |       |       |       |       |

If we round instead of truncating, we get:

    .0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 
    |_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|
    |       |       |       |       |

If we ignore the question of what to do with the point, these can be
expressed in a typical C environment as:

	unsigned int tenth_trunc = 0x1999;
	unsigned int tenth_round = 0x199A;

The extension of these representations to a 32 bit environment should be
obvious. For most of this discussion, we will confine ourselves to a 16
bit environment in order to slightly simplify the presentation.

Now, what about the point? When using fixed-point arithmetic, the
position of the point is implicit and is never explicitly represented
anywhere outside the comments in a program! (Don Gillies quoted John Von
Neumann once, saying that a competent programmer never needs floating
point hardware because he should always be able to keep the point in his
head.) The following brief discussion of fixed-point multiplication
illustrates this.


      General Rules for Fixed Point Arithmetic

The general rules for fixed-point binary arithmetic are the same rules
students learn in elementary school for doing arithmetic on decimal
numbers with a fractional part. That is, when adding, first align the
points and then add, and when multiplying, the number of places right of
the point in the product is the sum of the numbers of places right of
the point in the multiplicands. This is illustrated in the following
examples.

The examples that follow are based on fixed-point numbers A and B,
defined as follows:

	unsigned int A;  /* 4 bits right of the point */
	unsigned int B;  /* 8 bits right of the point */

Given these definitions, if A has the value 0x15, this is interpreted as
1 and 5/16, while if B has the value 0x15, this is is interpreted as
21/256. The sum A+B may be computed in two different ways, depending on
the precision desired:

	unsigned int S;
	S = B + (A << 4);        /* 8 bits right of the point */
	S = ((B + 8) >> 4) + A); /* 4 bits right of the point */

In the second case, when discarding fractional bits B prior to the sum,
we first added 1 in the most significant of the bits that were discarded
in order to round the result instead of truncating. Multiplication is
done as follows:

	unsigned int P; /* 12 places right of the point */
	P = A * B; /* places after point: 12 = 4 + 8 */

Here, we have simply taken the integer product of the multiplicands and
then, in the commentary, noted that the number of places to the right of
the point in the product is the sum of the number of places to the right
of the points in the multiplicands.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Basic Reciprocal Multiplication

When we multiply a 16 bit integer by a 16 bit fixed-point fraction
approximating 0.1, the result is a 32 bit quantity with 16 places left
of the point and 16 places right of the point. If what we want is the
integer part of the quotient, with no places to the right of the point,
we must therefore shift the product 16 places right.

	unsigned int A;
	unsigned int tenth_trunc = 0x1999; /* 16 bits right of the point */
	unsigned int Q; /* the quotient */

	Q = (A * tenth_trunc) >> 16;
	/* either Q = A/10 or Q+1 = A/10 for all A < 109,230 */

In those cases where the intended divisor has a reciprocal that can be
exactly represented as a fixed-point fraction, the result of reciprocal
multiplication will be exact. Unfortunately, our multiplier was not
exactly represented! The value of P computed by multiplying by an
approximation of .1 is only approximately what we want! The quotient may
be correct, or it may be one less than the actual value. The same is
true if a rounded approximation of 0.1 is used unless we use a bit of
extra precision!

It is worth noting that there are two common ways of providing multiply
support on an n-bit machine: One uses a single multiply instruction that
takes 2 n-bit operands and delivers a product of 2n bits in a pair of
registers. The other uses a pair of multiply instructions, one
delivering only the most significant n bits of the product and the other
delivering only the least significant n bits of the product. In either
case, the computation outlined here uses a single multiply instruction
and does not require a shift instruction. In the first case, we simply
use the register holding the high half of the product and ignore the
value in the other register. In the second case, we use the multiply
instruction that delivers only the high half of the product.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Correcting the Errors


      Using Extra Precision

One way to correct the errors introduced in reciprocal multiplication is
simply to use extra precision. Given that our goal is to divide a 16 bit
number by 10, it turns out that 4 bits of extra precision, with rounding
in the least significant bit, will suffice, as illustrated here:

	unsigned int A;
	unsigned int tenth_round = 0x1999A; /* 20 bits right of the point */
	unsigned int Q; /* the quotient */

	Q = (A * tenth_round) >> 20;
	/* Q = A/10 for all A < 81,920 */

The problem with this approach is that the rounded approximation given
here requires 20 bits and the product requires 36 bits prior to
shifting. On a 16 bit machine, products over 32 bits cannot be computed
directly using the hardware typically available, and we must use a
double-word to hold the approximate multiplier. Nonetheless, as we will
see, this approach is still quite useful!

First, quick inspection of our approximation of one tenth reveals that
it actually has only 16 significant bits! 0.1999A_16 or
0.000/1100110011001101/_2 is equal to 0.CCCD_16 or
0./1100110011001101/_2 divided by 8 or shifted three places right. The
latter is a fixed point binary approximation of 0.8_10 rounded to 16
bits, so we can divide by 10 using the following code using 16x16=32
multiplier:

        unsigned int A;
        unsigned int scaled_reciprocal = 0xCCCD;
		/* 0.8, 16 bits right of the point  */
        unsigned int shift_count = 19;
        unsigned int Q; /* the quotient */

        Q = (A * scaled_reciprocal) >> shift_count;
        /* Q = (A*0.8)/8 = A/10 for all A < 81,920 */

For a general algorithm for computing the approximation to use for an
arbitrary divisor, see Section 18.7 of Anger Fog's /How to optimize for
the Pentium family of microprocessors/, available in PDF format from
http://www.agner.org/assem/pentopt.pdf, which is indexed on the web at
http://www.agner.org/assem/#optimize. This contains a general algorithm
for computing the approximation to use for an arbitrary divisor. The
following table gives the scaled reciprocals and shift counts for
several common divisors:

n 	scaled reciprocal 	shift count
3 	1010101010101011 AAAB 	17
5 	1100110011001101 CCCD 	18
6 	1010101010101011 AAAB 	18
7 	10010010010010011 	19
9 	1110001110001111 E38F 	19
10 	1100110011001101 CCCD 	19
11 	1011101000101111 BA2F 	19
12 	1010101010101011 AAAB 	19
13 	1001110110001010 9D8A 	19
14 	10010010010010011 	20
15 	1000100010001001 8889 	19

All of these reciprocal approximations have been verified to give the
exact quotient for all possible 16 bit dividends. All but two of these
use a 16 bit approximation of the reciprocal and so can be substituted
into the code given above on a machine that gives a 32-bit product when
multiplying two 16-bit operands.

Unfortunately, it is not always possible to use a 16-bit approximation
of the reciprocal to get the correct quotient for a 16 bit dividend. In
the case of 1/7 and 1/14, for example, it takes a 17-bit approximation,
giving a 33-bit product prior to shifting. To handle this case in a
machine that only delivers a 32 bit product, we must first compute the
product using the least significant 16 bits of the scaled reciprocal and
then use shift-and add methods to add in the final partial product.

        unsigned int A;
        unsigned int Q; /* the quotient */

        Q = (((A * 0x2493) >> 16) + A) >> 3
	
        /* Q = A/7 for all A < 104,859 */

The general rule for finding the scaled reciprocal that gives the exact
quotient when dividing by a constant is as follows:

 1. Given d, the constant divisor, compute the exact reciprocal:
    r = 1/d
 2. 1/d will have z leading zeros between the point and its leftmost one:
    assert 0.5 /</ (1/d Ã 2^z ) < 1
 3. For an n-bit dividend, take the next n+1 bits and add 1 to round:
    r = int(1/d Ã 2^z+n+1 )+ 1
 4. The shift count is z+n+1
    int(a/d) = int( [a Ã (int(1/d Ã 2^z+n+1 )+ 1)] / 2^z+n+1 ) 

These rules always give an n+1 bit approximate reciprocal, but if the
result of the rounding step is even, we can use only the most
significant n bits of the approximate reciprocal and reduce the shift
count by one. For 16-bit operands, this works for 3, 5, 6 and 11, but
not for 7 and 9. In the case of 9, however, rounding up by two instead
of by one worked. This does not work for 7!

The following tables of successively more precise rounded approximations
illustrates how adding precision to the approximation extends the range
of dividends for which it gives the exact integer part of the quotient:

approximation of A/3 	exact so long as
AÃ0.011 	A < 8
AÃ0.01011 	A < 32
AÃ0.0101011 	A < 128
AÃ0.010101011 	A < 512
AÃ0.01010101011 	A < 2,048
AÃ0.0101010101011 	A < 8,192

approximation of A/5 	exact so long as
AÃ0.00111 	A < 14
AÃ0.001101 	A < 64
AÃ0.001100111 	A < 174
AÃ0.0011001101 	A < 1,024
AÃ0.0011001100111 	A < 2,734
AÃ0.00110011001101 	A < 16,384

approximation of A/7 	exact so long as
AÃ0.0010011 	A < 27
AÃ0.00100101 	A < 90
AÃ0.0010010011 	A < 209
AÃ0.00100100101 	A < 685
AÃ0.0010010010011 	A < 1,644
AÃ0.00100100100101 	A < 5,466

It would be nice if all optimal multipliers worked precisely up to some
power of two, but they do not, as is clearly demonstrated in the table
for 1/7. Nonetheless, the relationship between the number of significant
places in the multiplier and the precision of the result is clear. If
there are n places, inclusive, between the most significant one bit and
the least significant position that one could have been added in order
to round the exact reciprocal to produce this approximation, then
multiplying by this approximation will deliver the correct quotient for
all numbers up to 2^n-1 and sometimes up to but not including 2^n .

The following table gives the optimal reciprocals for division of 32-bit
unsigned numbers by small integers. Although this table is organized in
the same way as the table for 16-bit numbers, high-level-language
programmers on 32-bit machines will have difficulty using it because
most programming languages on 32-bit machines provide no way to access
the high 32 bits of the 64-bit product of two 32-bit unsigned numbers.

12 	10101010101010101010101010101011 AAAAAAAB 	35


      Fixing the Approximation

A second approach to fixing the approximate result is to compute the
remainder after multiplication and then correct the product if the
remainder is too large. This brute force approach is justified in some
settings, primarily those where the remainder is needed anyway and where
there is no hardware multiply instruction.

	unsigned int A;
	unsigned int tenth_trunc = 0x1999;
	unsigned int Q; /* the quotient */
	unsigned int R; /* the remainder */

	Q = (A * tenth_trunc) >> 16;
	/* either Q = A/10 or Q+1 = A/10 for all A < 109,230 */

	R = A - 10*Q;
	if (R >= 10) {
		Q = Q + 1;
		R = R - 10; /* optional */
	}
	/* Q = A/10 for all A < 109,230 */

This may seem expensive, involving as it does es a second multiply
instruction, where the typical hardware divide instruction is only twice
as time-consuming as the typical hardware multiply. In fact, as we will
see, some modern RISC processors can multiply by 10 with a single
add-and-shift instruction, and many can do it in 2 simple instructions,
so this cost may not be as great as it seems.

This approach always works! If we use the n bits immediately to the
right of the point in the reciprocal as the multiplier, the result will
be either the exact quotient or one less than the exact quotient.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Eliminating use of Multiply Hardware


      Architectural Features

Several modern RISC processors have register-to-register add
instructions equivalent to the following C statements:

	DST = ((SRC1 << S1) + SRC2) << S2;
	DST = ((SRC1 >> S1) + SRC2) >> S2;

Here, SRC1, SRC2 and DST are registers, and S1 and S2 are constant
shift-count fields that are part of the instruction; typically, S1 and
S2 are severely constrained and only permit small shifts or are limited
to powers of 2. There are other RISC machines that have less general
add-and-shift instructions, for example, instructions capable of
performing one or the other of the following, but not both:

        DST = (SRC1 << S1) + SRC2;
        DST = (SRC1 + SRC2) << S2;

A single shift-and-add instruction of the most general form illustrated
above can compute any product involving a constant multiplier with only
2 one bits set, for example:

	DST = ((SRC     ) + SRC)     ; /* times 2 */
	DST = ((SRC << 1) + SRC)     ; /* times 3 */
	DST = ((SRC     ) + SRC) << 1; /* times 4 */
	DST = ((SRC << 2) + SRC)     ; /* times 5 */
	DST = ((SRC << 1) + SRC) << 1; /* times 6 */
	DST = ((SRC     ) + SRC) << 2; /* times 8 */
	DST = ((SRC << 3) + SRC)     ; /* times 9 */
	DST = ((SRC << 2) + SRC) << 1; /* times 10 */
	DST = ((SRC << 1) + SRC) << 2; /* times 12 */

Multipliers such as 7, 11 and 13 require sequences of two instructions.
If less powerful shift-and-add instructions are used, we must use
multiple instructions for some of the above. For example, we might
multiply by 10 using the following two-instruction sequence:

	DST = (SRC << 2) + SRC; /* times 5 */
	DST = (DST     ) + DST; /* 5 + 5 = 10 */

If we are interested in the integer part of a fixed-point product, we
must use shift-and-add with right-shift operation instead of
left-shifting as above. The following examples illustrate
multiplications by fixed-point fractions with no more than 2 ones in the
multiplier:

	DST = ((SRC     )      ) >> 3; /* times 1/8 */
	DST = ((SRC     )      ) >> 2; /* times 1/4 */
	DST = ((SRC >> 1) + SRC) >> 2; /* times 3/8 */
	DST = ((SRC     )      ) >> 1; /* times 1/2 */
	DST = ((SRC >> 2) + SRC) >> 1; /* times 5/8 */
	DST = ((SRC >> 1) + SRC) >> 1; /* times 3/4 */

An important property of the shift-and-add instructions that is
essential to the correctness of the above code is that, for n-bit
arguments, the sum is n+1 bits, and the extra bit of the sum is shifted
into the high bit of the result when the result is right shifted.

Multiplication by 7/8 is not included in the above list because this
fraction, 0.111_2 has 3 ones and therefore cannot be done in a single
instruction. The missing product can be computed using the following
2-instruction sequence:

        DST = ((SRC >> 1) + SRC) >> 1; /* times 3/4 */
        DST = ((DST     ) + SRC) >> 1; /* (3/4 + 1)/2 = 7/8 */

      Approximate Multiplication by 1/10

The above general tools allow us to construct several sequences of
shift-and-add instructions for multiplying by the 16 bit fixed point
binary approximation of 1/10, 0.0001100110011001. The most
straightforward of these instruction sequences simply handles each bit
of the multiplier in sequence, from right to left, discarding the least
significant bits successively with each step in the computation:

	unsigned int A;
	unsigned int Q; /* the quotient */

	Q = ((A >> 3) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.1001 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.0011001 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.10011001 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.00110011001 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.100110011001 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 4; /* Q = A*0.0001100110011001 */
	/* either Q = A/10 or Q+1 = A/10 for all A < 109,230 */

The result in Q from the above code is exact in 16 bits, in the sense
that it gives the same result as multiplication by 1999_16 ! Several
other approaches to this computation are not exact. Because this code
discards the fractional bits of the quotient as soon as possible, it
never needs more than 16 bits of accumulator for the quotient. If A and
Q are 32 bit quantities, we must simply double the number of statements.

This straightforward code, fails to exploit repeating patterns in the
binary representation of the multiplier! One way to exploit these
patterns is to note that 1/10 can be represented as a sum:

       2/30  = 0.0001000100010001...    2/(10*3)
     + 1/30  = 0.0000100010001000...	1/(10*3)
    ---------------------------------
     = 1/10  = 0.0001100110011001...

Furthermore:

      16/255 = 0.0001000000010000...
     + 1/255 = 0.0000000100000001...
    --------------------------------
     = 1/15  = 0.0001000100010001...

We can tentatively exploit this as follows:

	Q = ((A >> 8) + A) >> 4; /* Q = A*0.000100000001 */
	Q = ((Q >> 4) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.0001000100010001 */
	Q = ((Q >> 1) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.00011001100110011 */
	/* either Q = A/10 or Q+1 = A/10 for all A < 30 */

The result is awful, but the problem is easy to locate! We discarded too
many of the less significant digits of the sum too quickly. If we defer
the right shifting that represents simple division by a power of 2 to
the very end, the result is far better:

	Q = ((A >> 8) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.100000001 */
	Q = ((Q >> 4) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.1000100010001 */
	Q = ((Q >> 1) + Q) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.00011001100110011 */
	/* either Q = A/10 or Q+1 = A/10 for all A < 451,070 */

But even this code performs its largest right-shift first, so we can
improve on it by changing the order in which the terms are added, adding
the largest terms first:

	unsigned int A;
	unsigned int Q; /* the quotient */

	Q = ((A >> 1) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.11 */
	Q = ((Q >> 4) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.110011 */
	Q = ((Q >> 8) + Q) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.00011001100110011 */
        /* either Q = A/10 or Q+1 = A/10 for all A < 534,890 */

This does not compute the exact same quotient as the original code
because it actually computes the product of A times a fixed point
approximation of 1/10 that is accurate to 19 places (including trailing
zeros) instead of the original 16 bit approximation, and this extra
precision allows our approximation to remain useful for dividends
slightly exceeding 2^19 .

The final code given above also works in 32 bits with only one
additional shift and add step:

	unsigned long int A;
	unsigned long int Q; /* the quotient */

	Q = ((A >>  1) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.11 */
	Q = ((Q >>  4) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.110011 */
	Q = ((Q >>  8) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.11001100110011 */
	Q = ((Q >> 16) + Q) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.000110011001100110011001100110011 */
        /* either Q = A/10 or Q+1 = A/10 for all 32-bit unsigned A */

But note: It is crucial that the carry out of the very first add in the
above code be shifted into the most significant bit position of the
shift applied to the result. Guaranteeing this in a high level language
like C is very cumbersome, but most machine languages trivially provide
for this. The final three add operations in the 32 bit version never
produce a carry out.

The general ideas in this and the following section are closely related
to the material presented in S.-Y. Li, "Fast constant division
routines," /IEEE Trans. Computers, C-34,/ 866-869 (Sept. 1985). The
primary difference is that Li does not guarantee that the successive
approximations of the quotient are all less than the dividend. As a
result, for arbitrary n-bit dividends, Li's schemes frequently require
n+1 bits in the accumulator.


      Approximate Multiplication by Other Small Reciprocals

The approach outlined above works for many other common reciprocals;
each of the approximations given below works up to the dividend value
cited in the comments; in each case, the example given is the shortest
sequence of shift-add-shift steps that has been found adequate for that
dividend on a 16-bit machine:

	/* approximate A/5 */
	Q = ((A >>  1) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.11 */
	Q = ((Q >>  4) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.110011 */
	Q = ((Q >>  8) + Q) >> 2; /* Q = A*0.0011001100110011 */
        /* either Q = A/5 or Q+1 = A/5 for all A < 185,365 */

	/* approximate A/6 */
	Q = ((A >>  2) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.101 */
	Q = ((Q >>  4) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.1010101 */
	Q = ((Q >>  8) + Q) >> 2; /* Q = A*0.00101010101010101 */
        /* either Q = A/6 or Q+1 = A/6 for all A < 222,438 */

	/* approximate A/7 */
	Q = ((A >>  3) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.1001 */
	Q = ((Q >>  6) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.1001001001 */
	Q = ((Q >> 12) + Q) >> 2; /* Q = A*0.001001001001001001001001 */
        /* either Q = A/7 or Q+1 = A/7 for all A < 60,577,223 */

	/* approximate A/9 */
	Q = ((A >>  1) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.11 */
	Q = ((Q      ) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.111 */
	Q = ((Q >>  6) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.111000111 */
	Q = ((Q >> 12) + Q) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.000111000111000111000111 */
        /* either Q = A/9 or Q+1 = A/9 for all A < 115,638,345 */

	/* approximate A/11 */
	Q = ((A >>  2) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.101 */
	Q = ((Q      ) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.1101 */
	Q = ((Q      ) + A) >> 2; /* Q = A*0.011101 */
	Q = ((Q      ) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.1011101 */
	Q = ((Q >> 10) + Q) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.00010111010001011101 */
        /* either Q = A/11 or Q+1 = A/11 for all A < 10,103,819 */

	/* approximate A/13 */
        Q = ((A >>  1) + A) >> 2; /* Q = A*0.011 */
        Q = ((Q      ) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.1011 */
        Q = ((Q      ) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.11011 */
        Q = ((Q      ) + A) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.00111011 */
        Q = ((Q      ) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.100111011 */
        Q = ((Q >> 12) + Q) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.0001001110110001 ... */
        /* either Q = A/13 or Q+1 = A/13 for all A < 190,894,093 */

	/* approximate A/15 */
        Q = ((A >>  4) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.10001 */
        Q = ((Q >>  8) + Q) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.0001000100010001 */
        /* either Q = A/15 or Q+1 = A/15 for all A < 864,015 */

Code for approximate division by 10, 12, 14, 18, 22, 26 and 30 can be
derived from the code for dividing by 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15 by
incrementing the final shift count by one. Comparison of the code for
division by 5 with the code given previously for division by 10
illustrates this. Similarly, adding two to the final shift count gives
code for division by 20, 24, 28, 36, 44, 52 and 60.

It would have been reasonable to expect to be able to divide by 3 using
a similar pattern, as follows:

	/* approximate A/3 */
	Q = ((A >>  2) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.101 */
	Q = ((Q >>  4) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.1010101 */
	Q = ((Q >>  8) + Q) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.0101010101010101 */
        /* either Q = A/3 or Q+1 = A/3 for all A < 12,723 */

Unfortunately, this does not work correctly for all 16-bit values! The
reason is that shifting away the least significant bit in each step
discarded too much. If we keep a bit of extra precision, we can solve
this problem:

	/* approximate A/3 */
	Q = ((A >>  2) + A)     ; /* Q = A*1.01 */
	Q = ((Q >>  4) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*1.010101 */
	Q = ((Q >>  8) + Q) >> 2; /* Q = A*0.0101010101010101 */
        /* either Q = A/3 or Q+1 = A/3 for all A < 111,219 */

The problem with this is that the intermediate approximations of the
quotient will be 4/3 the size of the dividend, so for arbitrary 16-bit
dividends, we need a 17-bit accumulator. Lacking this, we can use an
extra shift-add-shift step at the beginning to construct a larger
initial approximation before the sequence of shift-add-shift steps that
double the precision of this approximation.

	/* approximate A/3 */
	Q = ((A >>  2) + A) >> 2; /* Q = A*0.0101 */
	Q = ((Q      ) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.10101 */
	Q = ((Q >>  6) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.10101010101 */
	Q = ((Q >> 12) + Q) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.01010101010101010... */
        /* either Q = A/3 or Q+1 = A/3 for all A < 792,771 */

This is a good 16-bit solution, but adding a shift-add-shift step to try
to double the precision does not change the outcome! What we must do is
significantly increase the precision of the initial approximation. For a
16-bit dividend, we needed a 5-bit initial approximation. For a 32-bit
dividend, we need to add an additional 3 shift-add-shift steps to
produce an 11-bit initial approximation.

        /* approximate A/3 */
        Q = ((A >>  2) + A) >> 2; /* Q = A*0.0101 */
        Q = ((Q      ) + A) >> 2; /* Q = A*0.010101 */
        Q = ((Q      ) + A) >> 2; /* Q = A*0.01010101 */
        Q = ((Q      ) + A) >> 2; /* Q = A*0.0101010101 */
        Q = ((Q      ) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.10101010101 */
        Q = ((Q >> 12) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.10101010101010101010101 */
        Q = ((Q >> 24) + Q) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.010101010101001010101010101 ... */
        /* either Q = A/3 or Q+1 = A/3 for all 32-bit unsigned A */

As mentioned previously, this code only works if the carry out of the
add in each shift-add-shift step is shifted into the most significant
bit of the final shift. Assuring this in C is difficult!

In contrast to the case for division by 3, the code given above for
approximate division by larger divisors extends trivially to 32 bits:

	/* approximate A/5 */
	Q = ((A >>  1) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.11 */
	Q = ((Q >>  4) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.110011 */
	Q = ((Q >>  8) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.11001100110011 */
	Q = ((Q >> 16) + Q) >> 2; /* Q = A*0.001100110011001100110011001... */
        /* either Q = A/5 or Q+1 = A/5 for all 32-bit unsigned A */

	/* approximate A/6 */
	Q = ((A >>  2) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.101 */
	Q = ((Q >>  4) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.1010101 */
	Q = ((Q >>  8) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.101010101010101 */
	Q = ((Q >> 16) + Q) >> 2; /* Q = A*0.001010101010101010101010101... */
        /* either Q = A/6 or Q+1 = A/6 for all 32-bit unsigned A */

	/* approximate A/7 */
	Q = ((A >>  3) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.1001 */
	Q = ((Q >>  6) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.1001001001 */
	Q = ((Q >> 12) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.1001001001001001001001 */
	Q = ((Q >> 24) + Q) >> 2; /* Q = A*0.001001001001001001001001001... */
        /* either Q = A/7 or Q+1 = A/7 for all 32-bit unsigned A */

	/* approximate A/9 */
	Q = ((A >>  1) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.11 */
	Q = ((Q      ) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.111 */
	Q = ((Q >>  6) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.111000111 */
	Q = ((Q >> 12) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.111000111000111000111 */
	Q = ((Q >> 12) + Q) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.000111000111000111000111000... */
        /* either Q = A/9 or Q+1 = A/9 for all 32-bit unsigned A */

	/* approximate A/11 */
	Q = ((A >>  2) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.101 */
	Q = ((Q      ) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.1101 */
	Q = ((Q      ) + A) >> 2; /* Q = A*0.011101 */
	Q = ((Q      ) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.1011101 */
	Q = ((Q >> 10) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.10111010001011101 */
	Q = ((Q >> 20) + Q) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.000101110100010111010001011... */
        /* either Q = A/11 or Q+1 = A/11 for all 32-bit unsigned A */


      Fixing the Approximation

We can, of course, fix the results of this code by computing the
remainder and then forcing it in bounds. The following code illustrates
this for division by 10 and is easily generalized to other divisors:

        unsigned int A;
        unsigned int Q; /* the quotient */
	unsigned int R; /* the remainder */

	Q = ((A >> 1) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.11 */
	Q = ((Q >> 4) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.110011 */
	Q = ((Q >> 8) + Q) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.00011001100110011 */
        /* either Q = A/10 or Q+1 = A/10 for all A < 534,890 */

	R = ((Q << 2) + Q) << 1;
	R = A - R; /* R = A - 10*Q */
	if (R >= 10) {
		R = R - 10;
		Q = Q + 1;
	}
        /* Q = A/10 for all A < 534,890 */

It may be reasonable to code directly from this skeleton on a small
microcontroller, but on a modern pipelined RISC machine, it is better to
avoid the conditional branches implicit in the if statement given above.

Several modern RISC machines and also many microcontrollers have either
conditional skip or conditional store instructions; these test the
results of an arithmetic instructions and either force the next
instruction to be skipped if some condition is met or only store the
result if some condition is met. Such instructions have the property
that the code runs at exactly the same speed whether or not the
condition is met, and there are no branch penalties. Coding with such
instructions in mind, we get the following code:

        unsigned int A;
        unsigned int Q; /* the quotient */
        unsigned int R; /* the remainder */
        unsigned int T; /* temporary */

	Q = ((A >> 1) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.11 */
	Q = ((Q >> 4) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.110011 */
	Q = ((Q >> 8) + Q) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.00011001100110011 */
        /* either Q = A/10 or Q+1 = A/10 for all A < 534,890 */

	R = ((Q << 2) + Q) << 1;
	R = A - R;
	T = R - 10;
	if (T > 0) Q = Q + 1;
	if (T > 0) R = T;
        /* Q = A/10 for all A < 534,890 */

In the above, we have introduced a temporary variable, T, to eliminate
the redundant computations implied by the comparison and subtraction
code in the original if statement. A good compiler may be able to
perform this optimization automatically.

If we translated the above code to machine code on a RISC machine with
general add-shift-and-skip instructions, we can compute our approximate
quotient after the 3rd instruction, the approximate remainder after the
5th, and the corrected quotient after the 7th. On such a machine, no
more than 2 extra instructions are needed to compute the corrected
remainder, so we can get A/10 and A mod 10 in 9 instructions of
straight-line code.


      Using Extra Precision

As noted, it takes an extra bit of precision to produce an exact
quotient using reciprocal multiplication. For a 16-bit product, we need
a 17 bit rounded fixed-point multiplier. For division by 10, for
example, we multiply by 0x1999A or 0.00011001100110011010_2 . Rounding
has destroyed the clean repeating pattern of our truncated multiplier,
but if we ignore what we learned above about efficient ways to compute
the repeating fraction, we can use brute force to arrive at an exact
quotient as follows:

	unsigned int A;
	unsigned int Q; /* the quotient */

	Q = ((A >> 2) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.101 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.001101 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.1001101 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.0011001101 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.10011001101 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.00110011001101 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.100110011001101 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 4; /* Q = A*0.0001100110011001101 */
        /* Q = A/10 for all A < 81,920 */

Here, we arrived at an exact 16 bit quotient using 8 generalized
shift-and-add instructions, only one instruction more than our estimated
instruction count for the more clever approximate-and-correct code given
above! On a 16-bit machine, for most small divisors, this exact method
is generally comparable in cost to approximate division followed by a
fixup step.

For larger word sizes, the the approximate-and-correct methods generally
outperform this exact code. This is because the total number of
shift-add-shift steps required for the exact method is generally
proportional to the word size. In contrast, with the approximate methods
given here, each additional instruction typically doubles the precision.
The following code, for example, gives A/10 exact to 32 bits:

	Q = ((A >> 2) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.101 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.001101 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.1001101 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.0011001101 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.10011001101 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.00110011001101 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.100110011001101 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.001100110011001101 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.1001100110011001101 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.0011001100110011001101 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.10011001100110011001101 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.00110011001100110011001101 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.100110011001100110011001101 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.001100110011001100110011001101 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.1001100110011001100110011001101 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 4; /* Q = A*0.00011001100110011001100110011001101 */
	/* Q = A/10 for all 32-bit unsigned A */

If the approximate reciprocal has sufficiently few one bits, however,
the exact method will outperform the inexact method. For our small
divisors, the case of 15 provides a clear example of this:

	Q = ((A >> 3) + A) >> 4; /* Q = A*0.0001001 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 4; /* Q = A*0.00010001001 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 4; /* Q = A*0.000100010001001 */
	Q = ((Q     ) + A) >> 4; /* Q = A*0.0001000100010001001 */
	/* Q = A/15 for all A < 74,909 */

These four generalized shift-add-shift instructions for exact 16-bit
division by 15 clearly win over our approximate-and-correct method, and
extension to a 32-bit dividend remains competitive. Only when operand
sizes approach 64 bits does approximation followed by correction become
a clear winner.

Another case where the exact methods generally win is when the repeating
pattern used in the approximation is long and irregular, as it is for
division by 11 and 13. For these cases, the code to compute the
irregular pattern dominated the approximation for the 16-bit case. The
approximate-and-correct method still wins for these divisors in 32 bits.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


    Signed Dividends

In all of the above discussion, the focus has been on unsigned integers.
Division by negative divisors is relatively trivial. First divide by the
positive number, then negate both the remainder and quotient. Division
of signed dividends, however, poses more interesting problems.

The classic approach to division of a potentially negative number is to
record the sign, take the absolute value, and then restore the sign, as
follows:

	int A;
	int Q; /* the quotient */

	{
		int S = A < 0;
		unsigned int AA = A;
		if (S) AA = -AA;	/* AA = abs(A) */

		Q = AA / D;		/* divide */

		if (S) Q = -Q;		/* restore sign */
	}

This logic satisfies the vast majority of programmers, and in fact, this
is how division of a negative number by a positive dividend is defined
in FORTRAN. Unfortunately, it may be wrong!

The problem with the above algorithm is clear when we examine the
following incompatible requirements for integer division:

 1.   (-A) / D = -(A / D)
 2.   D(A / D) + (A mod D) = A
 3.   0 /</ (A mod D) < D 

At a quick glance, these appear to be obvious and true, but for cases
where A is negative and the remainder (A mod D) is nonzero, it is not
possible for all three to hold. The code framework given above is based
on rule 1, and if we define the mod operator as in rule 2, the
consequence is that nonzero remainders will have their sign determined
by the dividend and therefore, rule 3 will be violated.

Another way of describing the effect is to say that the code outlined
above truncates non-integer results towards zero. The effect is to round
the absolute value of the quotient down, and then restore the sign.

When we divide by a power of two using a sign-preserving right-shift
operator, the result is different. In that case, non-integer results are
truncated to the next more negative integer, so that truncation actually
increases the value of negative quotients. This preserves rules 2 and 3
above, while allowing rule 1 to be violated.

Which approach is right? This is not the right question. For some
applications, one approach may be preferred, while for others, the other
approach is likely to be better.

If the shift and add approach to reciprocal multiplication given in the
final section above is applied to signed dividends, the result is the
correct quotient, adhering to rules 2 and 3 above. Thus, for a 16-bit
divide by 10, the following code works:

        int A;
        int Q; /* the quotient */
	int R; /* the remainder */

	Q = ((A >> 1) + A) >> 1; /* Q = A*0.11 */
	Q = ((Q >> 4) + Q)     ; /* Q = A*0.110011 */
	Q = ((Q >> 8) + Q) >> 3; /* Q = A*0.00011001100110011 */
        /* either Q = A/10 or Q+1 = A/10 for -87,381 < A < 534,890 */

	R = ((Q << 2) + Q) << 1;
	R = A - R; /* R = A - 10*Q */
	if (R >= 10) {
		R = R - 10;
		Q = Q + 1;
	}
        /* Q = A/10 for -87,381 < A < 534,890 */

This code assumes that right-shift operators applied to signed operands
sign-extend the shifted operand, and it assumes that the very first
shift-add-shift sequence correctly accounts for the carry and overflow
conditions from the add step as it performs the second shift, so that
the result after the shift is as if no data was lost to an overflow in
the add step. With properly designed hardware, this is straightforward,
but not all computers offer good support in this area.

Notice that the range of values for which this works is not symmetrical!
Nonetheless, it is sufficient for all 16-bit signed divisors. This
asymmetry also shows up in the case of simple reciprocal multiplication.
Thus, where multiplication by 0.1999_16 produced an adequate
approximation of the quotient for 16-bit unsigned dividends, we must
multiply by 0.19998_16 to correctly approximate the quotient when
dealing with 16-bit signed dividends.

	int tenth_trunc = 0x3333; /* 17 bits right of the point */

	Q = (A * tenth_trunc) >> 17;
        /* either Q = A/10 or Q+1 = A/10 for -65,541 < A < 163,843 */

As noted previously, the above code gives the correct result under rules
2 and 3 given above for defining integer division. If the FORTRAN
version, adhering to rule 1 is desired, a fixup step can be added:

	if ((Q < 0) && (R != 0)) {
		R = R - 10;
		Q = Q + 1;
	}

Extension of these methods to 32 bits for signed dividends is
straightforward, but only the approximate division methods given for
unsigned dividends can be applied. The divisors that gave exact results
for unsigned dividends do not give exact results for negative dividends!

    Exhaustive Testing

It is easy to forget how fast modern machines are! Exhaustive testing of
algorithms for 16 bit arithmetic is not only practical but fast, and
given the difficulty of mathematical proof, it is worthwhile. All of the
unsigned shift and add code given above has been tested using the
following skeleton, written in C:

#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
        unsigned long int A = 0;
        for (;;) {
                unsigned long int Q;
                unsigned long int R;

                /* substitute appropriate code here */

                if ((A/10) != Q) break;
		A++;
		if (A == 0) break;
        }
        printf( "terminates with A = %lu\n", A );
        exit();
}

This code runs to completion in under a second for 16-bit divide
routines on an antique IBM RT workstation that, coincidentally, has no
integer multiply or divide hardware. On a modern fast machine such as
the Power PC G4, exhaustive testing on 32 bit code, or exhaustive tests
of 2-argument 16 arithmetic operations is entirely within reason;
exhaustive testing of the 32-bit code given above took well under an
hour, even with the awkward code required to preserve the carry out in
the initial shift-add-shift operations.
